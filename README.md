# 🎬 Netflix Shows and Movies - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores and analyzes the Netflix dataset containing information about TV shows and movies available on the platform. Using Python and visualization tools, we uncover trends, insights, and interesting patterns about Netflix's content catalog.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix's catalog.
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Identify content trends by **year**, **genre**, **type**, and **country**.
- Analyze content ratings and durations.
- Visualize relationships and distributions using effective plots.

## 📁 Files

- `netflix-shows-and-movies-exploratory-analysis.ipynb` – The Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and visualizations.
- `netflix_titles.csv` – The dataset used for analysis (typically sourced from Kaggle).
- `plots/` – (Optional) folder for saving graphs and figures.

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights

- Distribution of content types (Movies vs TV Shows).
- Top countries producing content on Netflix.
- Most common genres and their trends over time.
- Content added over the years.
- Rating distribution (TV-MA, PG, etc.).
- Average duration of movies and shows.
